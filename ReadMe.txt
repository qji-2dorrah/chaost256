   This Miner is the version

	v. 1.07

===============================


How is it working?
------------------

If needed : Disable your AntiVirus or Windows Defender Real Time Monitor (almost all miners are seen as virus)
- Launch the file "start.cmd"
- It should start mining after couple minute. You can see your Hash/second by tipping "h" key.
- After a few hours, you can go to alloins.pw/commandminer.php page to see your Balance to Cashout (in BTC)


This Miner can mine with your CPU (processor) + GPU (graphic card).

Some GPU are not compatible but CPU mining is working with all kind of CPU.


Happy mining !
